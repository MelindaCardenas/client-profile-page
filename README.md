# client-profile-page

Although this file won't work as intended without connection to the backend, it does demonstrate knowledge about fetch calls, functions, state, and bootstrap styling.

To watch demo video, click on the client-profile-page-demo_4MB.mov.zip, then click on the "view raw" button to download the zip file with the video.
